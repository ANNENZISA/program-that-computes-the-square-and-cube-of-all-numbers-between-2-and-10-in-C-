# program-that-computes-the-square-and-cube-of-all-numbers-between-2-and-10-in-C-
A program is required that computes the square and cube of all numbers between 2 and 10 and display them using a loop. The output should take the following format.
NB: 
Both of these programs output the same table of squares and cubes between 2 and 10, using either a do-while or for loop to iterate over the range of numbers.
